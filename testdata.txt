Write a cross-reference program that constructs a binary search tree with all words included
from a text file and records the line numbers on which these words were used. These line numbers
should be stored on linked lists associated with the nodes of the tree. After the input file
has been processed, print in alphabetical order all words of the text file along with the
corresponding list of numbers of the lines in which the words occur.
